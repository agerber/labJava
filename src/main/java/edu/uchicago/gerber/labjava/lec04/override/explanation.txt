Overriding facilitates polymorphism. it allows you to express subclasses in different ways. For example, let's say we have a game with
a Sprite class. Each subclass of sprite has a draw method that expresses itself itself differently.

Here are the conditions for potentially overriding a method
1/ you want to override
2/ you must override. What do you mean, you must override? What are the conditions in which you must override?
    A/ abstract classes
    B/ interfaces.
