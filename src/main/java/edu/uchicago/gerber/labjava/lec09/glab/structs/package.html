    <title>AP Computer Science Java Subset</title>
  </head>

  <body>

This is the annotated AP Computer Science Java Subset;
and this is the top-level package <code>ap</code> containing
AP interfaces and classes (those not part of the Java
distribution).
<P>
Note that the official AP Java subset is not in a package
<code>ap</code>, but this documentation shows it in a package
<code>ap</code> to make it clear that these classes
and interfaces are part of the AP Computer Science 
Java subset and not part of standard Java.
<P>
Interfaces and classes
that are in the package <code>ap</code>, and not in a sub-package,
are only used in the AB course.
