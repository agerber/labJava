	/*
	9. Using no date-specific Java libraries, write a program that computes
   the number of days between any two dates (inclusive). You must take
   into account leap years. The rule for computing a leap year is as
   follows: 
   
   If the year is divisible by 4 it is a Leap Year ...
   Unless the year is divisible by 100, then it is _not_ a Leap Year
   ...  Unless the year is divisible by 400, then it _is_ a Leap Year.
   
   During a Leap year, an extra day is added at the end of the month
   of Feb.

   ex. 1000 is not a Leap Year
       2000 is a Leap year

   Your program must be run as follows:
   PROMPT>> java DaysBetween 11/11/2002 11/12/2002
   1 day
   (program ends)

   Error checking. Be sure to handle at least the following:
     - if there is too few or too many input parameters
     - if the date strings are not in the proper format
        (simply echo usage statement);
     - if date 1 is not earlier than date 2
