 7) Remember the childhood game “Rock, Paper, Scissors”? It is a two-player game in which each person simultaneously
 chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors but loses to paper, paper beats rock but loses to scissors,
 and scissors beats paper but loses to rock. The following code prompts player 1 and player 2 to each enter a
 string: rock, paper, or scissors. Finish the code by adding nested if statements to appropriately report “Player 1
 wins”, “Player 2 wins”, or “It is a tie.”
