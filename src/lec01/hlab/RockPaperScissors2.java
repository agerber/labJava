 8) The program in Lab 3.7 was heavily nested with if statements, and it can be difficult to follow the logic of any
 program that is heavily nested in this way. By constructing complex conditions with the && operator, it is possible to
 simplify the code and remove some of the else alternatives. Rewrite the program in Lab 3.7 using complex conditions and
 omitting the else construct.
